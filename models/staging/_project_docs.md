# DVD Rental Database Transformations

This project is focused on utilizing a DVD rental database to gain insights and make data-driven decisions 
for a retail store. Using DBT, we will be able to transform and clean the data in order to make it usable for 
analysis. 

The project will then proceed to segment the data based on different departments, such as finance, marketing, 
stores, and films. Each department will have specific objectives and will analyze the data accordingly. The 
finance department will look at revenue and profit, the marketing department will examine customer behavior, 
the stores department will focus on inventory and store metadata, and the films department will investigate 
the films themselves. 

By utilizing the data in this manner, the store will be able to make informed decisions that will help improve 
their performance. This project will demonstrate how DBT can prove to be a valuable tool for data cleaning and
transformations, enabling analysts to make data-driven business decisions.
