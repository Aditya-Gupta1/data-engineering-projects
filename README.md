| Jan 2023 - Present      	 | Data Engineering 	 |  [de-zoomcamp-2023](https://github.com/Aditya-Gupta1/data-engineering-projects/tree/de-zoomcamp-2023)	| Python, Docker, Terraform, Prefect |

The Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2023 course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of data engineering techniques and practices. The course includes various 
assignments and projects that cover a wide range of topics such as data pipeline development (ETL/ELT), data warehousing, workflow orchestration and many such things.

### DVD Rental Data Transformation Pipeline using [DBT (Data Build Tool)](https://www.getdbt.com/)

| Jan 2023 	     | Analytics Engineering 	| [dvdrental](https://github.com/Aditya-Gupta1/data-engineering-projects/tree/dvdrental) 	| DBT, Metabase, Docker, SQL        	 |

This DBT project utilizes the DVD rental database and implements various transformations to clean and structure the data. A dashboard is then created to display the insights 
and analysis derived from the transformed data. The project demonstrates the use of DBT to perform data modeling and manipulation tasks, as well as the ability to create a 
user-friendly interface for data visualization.

### Telecom Customer Data Transformation Pipeline using DBT

### Polygon ETL Pipeline using [MageAI](https://www.mage.ai/)

| **Date** 	| **Domain**   	| **Branch**                                                                                       	| **Skills**     	|

| Dec 2022 	| ETL Pipeline 	| [mageai-polygon](https://github.com/Aditya-Gupta1/data-engineering-projects/tree/mageai-polygon) 	| MageAI, Python 	|

This project is an exploration of using MageAI to build an ETL pipeline. The pipeline is designed to extract data from Polygon API, transform it to fit 
the desired format, and load it into a Postgres database. The pipeline is implemented using MageAI, a powerful tool for building and deploying data pipelines 
quickly and easily. This project demonstrates the capabilities of MageAI in terms of data extraction, transformation, and loading, and serves as a guide for 
those interested in using MageAI for their own data pipeline projects.

### MapReduce Examples

| Dec 2022 	| Big Data   	| [mapreduceexamples](https://github.com/Aditya-Gupta1/data-engineering-projects/tree/mapreduceexamples) 	| MapReduce, Python 	|

This repository contains a collection of map-reduce code written in Python. The code is developed as a part of an Udemy course on big data processing using Hadoop and 
Map-Reduce. The course provides an introduction to the concepts of big data and distributed computing, and covers the fundamentals of Hadoop and Map-Reduce programming.
